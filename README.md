Made this JSON to CSV convertor using HTML and Javascript.

One can add any JSON file(not nested) either by clicking on the box or by dragging and dropping.

When the download button is pressed, the CSV file automatically downloads in your system.

Used dropzone library to make a drag and drop area.

Using FileReader, the dragged JSON file is read and stored in a variable which is then converted to CSV on the click of download.

Some preview of the app looks like:
