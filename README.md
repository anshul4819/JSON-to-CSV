I made this JSON to CSV convertor using HTML and Javascript.

You can add any JSON file either by clicking on the boz or by drag and drop.

When the download button is pressed, the csv file automatically download in your system.

Used dropzone library to make a drag and drop area.

Then using FileReader, the dragged JSON file is read and stored in a variable which is then converted to csv on the click of download.
